            <p>In today's passages Jesus continues to reveal more of himself to those who ask. He answers the followers of John the Baptist, very straight-forwardly, that He is indeed the Messiah. After some discussion about the Sabbath, Jesus answers some Pharisees that He is greater than the law. He continues to teach with much authority and wisdom; using many parables to illustrate what God the Father had sent Him to accomplish.</p>
            <p>Through all these revelations, explanations, and illustrations we still find people—particularly those from His hometown—rejecting His counsel, His truth, and His love.</p>

                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">Go…tell him what you have heard and seen</p>
                    <p>Him being John the Baptist. Think about it, JTB was the <em>prepare-the-way-man</em>. He knew what was coming. But at this point, he was separated from that. He didn't even know what was happening at that present time. He was in prison and only heard snippets of what was happening outside. He was not able to see the full ministry of Jesus. I'm sure this would have been difficult for JTB.</p>
                    <p>Anyone else feel isolated sometimes? Out of touch perhaps? Maybe even out of reach? It happens to the best of us.</p>
                    <p>Friend, from what I've seen. From what I've heard. <strong>Nothing can separate you from the love of God.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>There are many who just see or know of snippets of Jesus—not the full picture. I, on the other hand, have <strong><em>personally seen and heard from Jesus</em></strong>. I too <em>must go tell others</em>. Am I able to maintain a full picture of Jesus work in my life and around me? <strong>Does my life give a good picture of what Jesus has done? 📸</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>The Pharisees asked Jesus, “Does the law permit a person to <strong><em>work</em></strong> by <em>healing</em> on the Sabbath?” (They were hoping he would say yes, so they could bring charges against him.) Jesus replied: Yes, the law permits a person to do <strong><em>good</em></strong> on the Sabbath.</p>
                    <p><strong>Amazing the difference one word can make to my view of what I <em>should</em> be doing.</strong> Think about it. We can spend our lives working. Or we can live our lives doing good. 😇 BTW, everyday is a holy day when Christ is in your heart.</p>

                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">The privilege. My, oh, my. How privileged are we?</p>
                    <p>But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear. I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but they didn’t see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn’t hear it. (Matt 13.16-17)</p>
                    <p>We don't just get an <em>explanation</em>. We get Christ himself. Not a proxy. Not another story. We get God's love fully expressed in Jesus. <em>Yeah, we're part of a privileged lot.</em></p>
