            <p>Good day! I hope the freshness of the today reminds you of God's mercies that are new every morning.</p>
            <p>Take a camel. Now take a needle. Consider the eye of the needle. That small, small hole where you loop the thread. Now get the camel and put it through the eye of the needle. Impossible, you say! And that is the point.</p>
            <p>Jesus was saying there is no way man can save himself. Do all the tricks. Try to follow all the rules. Attempt as we might, we still fail. It would be easier for the camel to take a trip through that needle-eye than for us to get ourselves out of our mess.</p>
            <p><strong>with Him, through Him, in Him we are saved. The impossible made possible.</strong></p>

            <div class="space-y-12">
                <div>
                    <p>Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts, but it was not what God had originally intended. (Matt 19.8)</p>
                    <p><strong>Have you ever considered what things God has <em>allowed</em> in your life because of your hard heart?</strong> My mind is in a loop now. The lesser concessions I have been granted because I am stubborn. 😪</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">Oh yes, we are able!</p>
                    <p>This is in response to Jesus's question: Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink? (Matt 20.22)</p>
                    <p>Talk about biting off more than you can chew. If they knew what suffering Jesus was about to take, do you think they would have been so forward? I don't think I would. Or maybe sometimes I am too gung-ho for my own good. Either way, we all have a part to play and place to take in God's kingdom. (Matt 20.23)</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">Lord, we want to see!</p>
                    <p>This was the loud request of two blind men. So noisy were they, that they out shouted a crowd (Matt 20.31). Should I not be the same? Should I not be as imperative? As loud. As sure. Regardless of what the crowd says.<strong> Should I not do all for me to see my Lord? </strong>👀</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">Instantly they could see! Then they followed him. (Matt 20.34)</p>
                    <p>We are given sight so that we can see for ourselves. We can see for ourselves, and so we can choose for ourselves. It's no longer the blind leading the blind. We can each make an informed decision about following Jesus. 💁‍♀️</p>
