        <article class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-24 space-y-8 text-zinc-600">
            <p>I really am amused by this account (beginning at John 4.31). The disciples are telling Jesus to eat. You have to eat, they say.</p>
            <p>Jesus responds: I got food that you know nothing about. The disciples looked at each other quizzically: did any of you give the Rabbi food? What other food is He talking about?</p>
            <p>Jesus was so on another level. A different plane. Another dimension. His playing field was so out there that, in this conversation, it became glaringly obvious that His disciples were not even close to playing the same game.</p>
            <p>The disciples were talking about food to eat. Hamburgers. Pizza. Burritos. Deep-fried chicken. However, for Jesus, fulfilment and satisfaction came from carrying out His Father’s will.</p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-teal">Now, I’m sure Jesus felt hunger, but being at the centre of God’s will takes you out of this world.</p>

                    <p>We know this part of the Gospel as a broadcast to the whole world. An assurance and promise to all. However, in the scene where Jesus said this, He was in a one-on-one conversation with Nicodemus.</p>
                    <p>Can you imagine hearing these words for the first time and this being told to you in person by the Son of God himself?</p>

                    <p class="italic mb-4">Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and his entire household believed in Jesus. (John 4.34-35)</p>
                    <p>Can you remember the exact time, that precise moment that Jesus changed your life?</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-teal mt-4">Perhaps it can be today? Mark the day. Mark the time. Ask Jesus: please heal my hurt; mend my heart; change my life.</p>
