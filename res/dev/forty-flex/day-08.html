            <p>I start today with a mountain-top gathering with Jesus, Moses and Elijah (definitely not a Zoom meeting). There, Peter the disciple, speaks quick and oversteps his mark (he is very endearing that way; I can totally relate).</p>
            <p>Speaking of endearing, Jesus tells his followers (who were jousting for position in God's Kingdom) that children—the little kids—are the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. Then Jesus gives a math class: leaving the 99, and 70 times 7.</p>

            <div class="space-y-12">
                <div>
                    <p>There's so much in this passage, but please allow me to spend some time on this one verse.</p>
                    <p><strong>... so go down to the lake and throw in a line. 🎣 Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin. 🪙 Take it and pay the tax for both of us.</strong> (Matt 17.27)</p>
                    <p>I have so many questions about this. Don't you?</p>
                    <p>It sounds like a magic show, right? Sorry Jesus, I mean no offence, but why not just produce a silver coin? And what's with the tax? And how did a coin end up in a fish? How large was the coin? And what kind of fish was it to take a coin that large? And how did this specific coin-eating-fish bite on Peter's hook? And what did Peter use as bait? And why did Peter go along with this? And why... 🤷‍♂️ So many questions!</p>
                    <p>Many had their hand at explaining it. Many differing answers have been given. For me (at least, for now), I am happy with these morsels:</p>
                    <p><strong>God always provides. 🎁</strong> He always does! Never has He not shown up with <em>more than enough</em>. He has proven time and time again that He is faithful. Ask anyone in my family. You won't need to fish for answers. We will reply directly.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">God provides creatively. 👨‍🎨</p>
                    <p>It's never just the one way or same way. I find that God uses different scenarios; different people; different channels to provide. My issue is that I am a creature of habit. I like a <em>regular</em> payday. Every two weeks. The first Thursday of every month. Which ever. As long as it is <em>regular</em>. But God likes to mix it up. Flex all available channels. Including a fish. Have you been part of God's creativity?</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="font-bold text-charcoal mb-4 font-display">God has a wonderful sense of humour. 😂</p>
                    <p>I am sure God enjoys a good laugh. I don't think He sits there po-faced and dour. I honestly believe that He <em>delights</em> in you and in me. I also believe that He makes ways—I mean actively makes ways, sets up a scene, directs dialogue–for me to enjoy him. For us to delight in Him.</p>
                    <p>The perfect sunset. The right song playing at the right time. 📻 The message just when you needed it. Just the right person. Surprise! You're married to your grade-school friend. <em>Wait, what?</em></p>
                    <p>I can imagine Peter. Walking to the lake. Mumbling: <em>There's totally nothing 🐡 fishy about this...</em></p>
